    <h1>This Is The Life</h1>
    <p>Oh the wind whistles down<br>
        The cold dark street tonight<br>
        And the people they were dancing<br>
        To the music vibe<br>
        <br>
        And the boys chase the girls, with curls in their hair<br>
        While the shocked too many sit way over there<br>
        And the songs get louder each one better than before<br>
        <br>
        And you singing the song thinking this is the life<br>
        And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size<br>
        where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?<br>
        And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the sizxe<br>
        Where you gonna go, where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?<br>
        Where you gonna sleep tonight<br>
        </p>
