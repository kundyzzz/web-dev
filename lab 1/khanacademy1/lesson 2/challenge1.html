        <p><strong>Penguins</strong> are flightless birds that live mainly in the Southern Hemisphere. They are known for their unique body shape, which helps them swim and dive. There are 18 species of penguins, each of which has its own characteristics. For example, the largest species is <em>the emperor penguin</em>, and the smallest is <em>the lesser penguin</em>.<br>
           <br> When swimming underwater, penguins are silent, and when they are on the ground, they talk to each other, making sounds similar to trumpet sounds. They feed on fish, shellfish and squid. One of the "uniqueness" of these birds is that they do not need fresh water: they can quench their thirst with salt and sea water. Penguins live in large families â€“ <strong>flocks</strong>.
